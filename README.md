# Automatic Knee Rehabilitation Exercises using Collaborative Robot

This project focuses on developing a **robotic knee rehabilitation system** using the **UR3 robotic arm** to simulate post-surgery physiotherapy exercises. The system replicates:

- **Knee Flexion/Extension Exercises**
- **Range of Motion Testing**
- **Resistance Simulation Exercises**

The goal is to assist in patient recovery following knee surgeries.

## **Robot Used**
**Universal Robot (UR3):**
- A compact collaborative robotic arm designed for tasks requiring precision.
- Known for its controlled motion capabilities, making it ideal for repetitive and rehabilitation tasks.

---

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Flexion/Extension:**
   - Simulate controlled knee movements.
   - Ensure precise, safe motion within a pre-defined range.

2. **Range of Motion Testing:**
   - Measure maximum flexion and extension angles.
   - Collect data on controlled knee movement.

3. **Resistance Simulation:**
   - Apply controlled resistance to knee movements.
   - Measure the force required to overcome resistance.

## **Setup Description**

The setup includes:

- **UR3 Robotic Arm:** Programmed for controlled flexion/extension, range of motion testing, and resistance simulation.
- **Mannequin Bone Model:** Represents a realistic knee joint, fixed securely in place.
- **Mounting Frame:** Ensures stability for accurate and repeatable movements.
- **Force Calibration Tools:** Used for measuring applied resistance.

---

## **Tool Details**

- **End-Effector:** Customized attachment mounted on the UR3 for interacting with the knee joint.
- **Attachment Plan:** Securely attached to the UR3â€™s flange for precise manipulation of the joint.

---

## **Mock-Up**

- **Mannequin Bone Model:** A mannequin bone model representing the knee joint (femur, tibia, patella) will simulate real knee movements. The UR3 will interact with this mock-up for rehabilitation exercises.
