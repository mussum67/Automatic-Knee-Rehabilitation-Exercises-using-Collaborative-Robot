# Automatic-Knee-Rehabilitation-Exercises-using-Collaborative-Robot
This project focuses on developing a robotic knee rehabilitation system using the UR3 robotic arm to simulate post-surgery physiotherapy exercises. The system replicates knee flexion/extension exercises, range of motion testing, and resistance simulation exercises, aiming to assist in patient recovery following knee surgeries 
Robot Used
Universal Robot (UR3):
The UR3 is a compact collaborative robotic arm known for its precision and suitability for repetitive tasks. Its controlled motion capabilities make it ideal for the knee rehabilitation project.

Project Objectives
1. Flexion/Extension
Simulate controlled knee movements.
Ensure precise, safe motion within a pre-defined range.
2. Range of Motion Testing
Measure maximum flexion and extension angles.
Collect data on controlled knee movement.
3. Resistance Simulation
Apply controlled resistance to knee movements.
Measure the force required to overcome resistance.
Setup Description
The setup includes:

UR3 Robotic Arm: Programmed for controlled movements.
Mannequin Bone Model: Fixed to simulate a realistic knee joint.
Mounting Frame: Ensures stability for accurate movements.
Force Calibration Tools: Used for measuring applied resistance.
Tool Details
End-Effector: Customized attachment on the UR3 for interacting with the knee joint.
Attachment Plan: Mounted securely on the UR3â€™s flange for safe manipulation.
Mock-Up
A mannequin bone model representing the knee joint (femur, tibia, patella) will simulate real knee movements. The UR3 will interact with this mock-up for rehabilitation exercises.
